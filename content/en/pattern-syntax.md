title: Parsing Pattern Syntax
description: One parser per precedence level turns real regex notation like (colou?r|gr[ae]y) into the trees the engine already understands.
---

# Parsing Pattern Syntax

The combinators are on the workbench; time to build the thing we bought them for. By the end of this chapter, `(colou?r|gr[ae]y)` is a string a user can hand us, and a tree our engine can run.

## The grammar

Regex notation has precedence, just like arithmetic. In `ab|c`, the juxtaposition binds tighter than the bar — it means `(ab)|c`, not `a(b|c)`. In `ab*`, the star binds tighter still: `a(b*)`. Written as a grammar, loosest binding first — this is the module doc comment of `regex/src/Regex/Syntax.idr`:

```
alternation := sequence ('|' sequence)*
sequence    := repetition*
repetition  := atom ('*' | '+' | '?' | '{' count '}')*
atom        := '(' alternation ')' | '[' class ']'
             | '.' | '\' escape | plain character
```

The mapping rule that turns this grammar into code is beautifully mechanical: **one parser per precedence level**, each level's parser built out of calls to the next-tighter level. `alternation` calls `sequenceOf`, which calls `repetition`, which calls `atom` — and `atom`, at the bottom, loops back up to `alternation` for parenthesized groups. That loop is what makes the grammar recursive, and it will teach us something real about lazy versus strict evaluation before the chapter is out.

## Red: specs in three flavors

`regex/tests/src/Spec/Syntax.idr` opens with two helpers, because "compile this pattern and match that input" is about to be said twenty times:

```idris
||| Does the pattern compile and match the input?
ok : String -> String -> Bool
ok pat input =
  case compile pat of
    Just r  => matches r input
    Nothing => False

||| Does the pattern compile and reject the input?
no : String -> String -> Bool
no pat input =
  case compile pat of
    Just r  => not (matches r input)
    Nothing => False
```

Note that `no` is not `not . ok` — a pattern that *fails to compile* should count as neither. The first flavor of spec checks **structure**: the parser must produce exactly the trees we expect, precedence included:

```idris
export
syntaxSpecs : List Spec
syntaxSpecs =
  [ -- structure: the parser produces exactly the trees we expect
    shouldBe "the empty pattern is Eps"
      (compile "") (Just Eps)
  , shouldBe "a single character is a literal"
      (compile "a") (Just (lit 'a'))
  , shouldBe "juxtaposition is concatenation"
      (compile "ab") (Just (Cat (lit 'a') (lit 'b')))
  , shouldBe "the bar is alternation"
      (compile "a|b") (Just (Alt (lit 'a') (lit 'b')))
  , shouldBe "concatenation binds tighter than the bar"
      (compile "ab|c") (Just (Alt (Cat (lit 'a') (lit 'b')) (lit 'c')))
  , shouldBe "postfix operators bind tightest of all"
      (compile "ab*") (Just (Cat (lit 'a') (Star (lit 'b'))))
  , shouldBe "parentheses regroup"
      (compile "a(b|c)") (Just (Cat (lit 'a') (Alt (lit 'b') (lit 'c'))))
  , shouldBe "the wildcard is the any-character set"
      (compile ".") (Just (Sym anyChar))
```

The fifth and sixth specs *are* the precedence table, executable. If we ever wire the levels up in the wrong order, these two go red.

The second flavor checks that **malformed input is rejected** — trailing garbage is a failure, not a warning:

```idris
    -- malformed patterns are rejected, not guessed at
  , shouldBe "an unbalanced group does not compile"
      (compile "a)") Nothing
  , shouldBe "an unterminated class does not compile"
      (compile "[abc") Nothing
  , shouldBe "an unterminated count does not compile"
      (compile "a{2") Nothing
```

And the third flavor is **behavior** — the classics, plus everything the last three chapters built, now reachable by typing it:

```idris
    -- behavior: the classics
  , it "colou?r matches both spellings"
      (ok "colou?r" "color" && ok "colou?r" "colour")
  , it "gr[ae]y matches both spellings, nothing else"
      (ok "gr[ae]y" "gray" && ok "gr[ae]y" "grey" && no "gr[ae]y" "groy")
  , it "classes can be negated: [^0-9]+"
      (ok "[^0-9]+" "hello" && no "[^0-9]+" "hell0")
  , it "escaped metacharacters are plain characters"
      (ok "\\(\\)" "()" && ok "3\\.14" "3.14" && no "3\\.14" "3014")
  , it "\\d, \\w and \\s shorthands work"
      (ok "\\d+" "2026" && ok "\\w+" "snake_case" && ok "a\\sb" "a b")
  , it "negated shorthands too: \\D rejects digits"
      (ok "\\D+" "abc" && no "\\D+" "ab1")
  , it "counted repetition: a{3} and a{2,4} and a{2,}"
      (ok "a{3}" "aaa" && no "a{3}" "aa"
        && ok "a{2,4}" "aaaa" && no "a{2,4}" "aaaaa"
        && ok "a{2,}" "aaaaaa" && no "a{2,}" "a")
  , it "a real-world shape: \\w+@\\w+\\.\\w+"
      (ok "\\w+@\\w+\\.\\w+" "user@example.com"
        && no "\\w+@\\w+\\.\\w+" "not an email")
  , it "a date pattern, this time written as a pattern"
      (ok "\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}" "2026-07-14"
        && no "\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}" "2026-7-14")
  ]
```

(Three more behavior specs of the same shape — ranges `[a-c]+`, the wildcard's exactly-one-character rule, and `(ha)+` repeating as a unit — are in the commit; twenty-three specs in all.) The date pattern from the [sugar chapter](./sugar.md), which took a `where` block of nested function calls, is now seventeen characters.

```sh
make test
```

Error: Module Regex.Syntax not found

Spec.Syntax:11:1--11:20
 ...
 11 | import Regex.Syntax
      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

Twenty-three specs red at once — more than any red step so far. This is commit [302ad49](https://github.com/ubugeeei-prod/lets-start-functional/commit/302ad496f1e0f0ca423c9f9853ad38ac7e058756).

## Green: the pattern parser

`Regex/Syntax.idr` imports everything we have, makes one admission up front, and names the characters that cannot stand for themselves:

```idris
-- A recursive grammar needs recursive parsers, and those (like
-- many/some) are honest `covering` functions rather than `total`.
%default covering

||| Characters that mean something special outside a class.
isMeta : Char -> Bool
isMeta c = elem c (unpack "()[]{}|*+?.\\")
```

### Escapes

A backslash escape shows up in two roles. Inside a class, `\n` should give us a *character*; at the top level, `\d` should give us a whole *regex atom*. Two small parsers:

```idris
||| A backslash escape interpreted as a single character:
||| `\n`, `\t`, `\r`, or any escaped literal like `\.` or `\\`.
escapedChar : Parser Char
escapedChar = char '\\' *> map interp anyToken
  where
    interp : Char -> Char
    interp 'n' = '\n'
    interp 't' = '\t'
    interp 'r' = '\r'
    interp c   = c

||| A backslash escape interpreted as a regex atom. The shorthand
||| classes expand to the sets from `Regex.Set`; anything else is
||| the escaped character itself.
escapedAtom : Parser Regex
escapedAtom = char '\\' *> map interp anyToken
  where
    interp : Char -> Regex
    interp 'd' = Sym digit
    interp 'D' = Sym (complement digit)
    interp 'w' = Sym word
    interp 'W' = Sym (complement word)
    interp 's' = Sym space
    interp 'S' = Sym (complement space)
    interp 'n' = lit '\n'
    interp 't' = lit '\t'
    interp 'r' = lit '\r'
    interp c   = lit c
```

Savor the `'D'` line. In [Character Classes](./character-classes.md) we made `complement` a single field flip — and here is the dividend: the negated shorthand `\D`, a feature in its own right in most regex engines, costs us exactly one call to `complement`. Good representations keep paying after you have forgotten choosing them.

### Classes

Class syntax — `[a-c]`, `[^0-9]`, `[\d_-]` — is its own miniature language, so it gets its own parsers. Every class *item* contributes a list of ranges, and the whole class concatenates them:

```idris
||| Inside a class, `\d` `\w` `\s` contribute their ranges.
shorthandRanges : Parser (List (Char, Char))
shorthandRanges =
  char '\\' *>
    (   (char 'd' *> pure (ranges digit))
    <|> (char 'w' *> pure (ranges word))
    <|> (char 's' *> pure (ranges space)))

||| A literal character inside a class: anything but `]`, `\` or
||| `-` — those need escaping.
classChar : Parser Char
classChar = escapedChar <|> satisfy (\c => not (elem c (unpack "]\\-")))

||| One item of a class: a shorthand, a range `a-z`, or a single
||| character. Every item contributes a list of ranges.
classItem : Parser (List (Char, Char))
classItem = shorthandRanges <|> rangeOrSingle
  where
    rangeOrSingle : Parser (List (Char, Char))
    rangeOrSingle = do
      lo <- classChar
      (do _  <- char '-'
          hi <- classChar
          pure [(lo, hi)])
        <|> pure [(lo, lo)]

||| A whole class: `[...]` or negated `[^...]`.
classAtom : Parser Regex
classAtom = do
  _     <- char '['
  neg   <- (char '^' *> pure True) <|> pure False
  items <- some classItem
  _     <- char ']'
  pure (Sym (MkSet neg (concat items)))
```

`rangeOrSingle` is Monad and Alternative working together: parse a character, then *try* to continue with `-hi`; if that fails, the character stood alone. (In `shorthandRanges`, `ranges digit` is just record-field access used as a function — the list of ranges inside `digit`.) And `classAtom` reads like its own grammar rule — bracket, optional caret, items, bracket — before assembling a `MkSet` directly. The parser and the representation from two chapters ago click together with no adapter in between.

### Postfix operators are functions

Here is the chapter's slickest idea. What *is* `*` in `ab*`? It is something that takes the regex to its left and transforms it. So parse it as exactly that — a function:

```idris
||| A counted repetition suffix: `{n}`, `{n,}` or `{n,m}`.
counted : Parser (Regex -> Regex)
counted = do
  _ <- char '{'
  n <- natural
  f <- (do _ <- char ','
           (do m <- natural
               pure (between n m))
             <|> pure (atLeast n))
       <|> pure (exactly n)
  _ <- char '}'
  pure f

||| A postfix operator, as a *function on regexes*. `a**?` is legal
||| and pointless, exactly like in the AST.
postfix : Parser (Regex -> Regex)
postfix =
      (char '*' *> pure star)
  <|> (char '+' *> pure plus)
  <|> (char '?' *> pure opt)
  <|> counted
```

`postfix` has type `Parser (Regex -> Regex)` — a parser whose *result is a function*. In a language where functions are values, that is not exotic; it is Tuesday. `char '*' *> pure star` says: see a star character, produce the `star` smart constructor itself. The three-way branch inside `counted` mirrors the three syntaxes: `{n,m}` gives `between n m`, `{n,}` gives `atLeast n`, bare `{n}` gives `exactly n` — each a partially applied function from the sugar chapter, waiting for its regex.

### The grammar itself

Four rules, one `mutual` block, each rule calling the next-tighter one:

```idris
mutual
  ||| Lowest precedence: sequences separated by `|`.
  alternation : Parser Regex
  alternation = do
    first <- sequenceOf
    rest  <- many (char '|' *> sequenceOf)
    pure (foldl alt first rest)

  ||| Middle precedence: juxtaposition. Zero atoms is `Eps`,
  ||| which is why the empty pattern compiles.
  sequenceOf : Parser Regex
  sequenceOf = map (foldr cat Eps) (many repetition)

  ||| Highest precedence: an atom with its postfix operators,
  ||| applied left to right.
  repetition : Parser Regex
  repetition = do
    a     <- atom
    posts <- many postfix
    pure (foldl (\r, f => f r) a posts)

  ||| The atoms. `recur` delays the self-reference in `group` —
  ||| see `Regex.Parse.recur` for why.
  atom : Parser Regex
  atom = group <|> classAtom <|> wildcard <|> escapedAtom <|> plain
    where
      wildcard : Parser Regex
      wildcard = char '.' *> pure (Sym anyChar)

      plain : Parser Regex
      plain = map lit (satisfy (not . isMeta))

  group : Parser Regex
  group = char '(' *> recur alternation <* char ')'
```

Every fold here is earning its keep. `sequenceOf` folds `cat` over the atoms — the same `foldr cat Eps` shape as `literal` in the sugar chapter. `repetition` folds *function application* itself: `posts` is a list of `Regex -> Regex` functions, and `foldl (\r, f => f r) a posts` pipes the atom through each in left-to-right order, so `a*?` is `opt (star a)`, just as the notation reads. And `alternation` folds `alt` across the `|`-separated branches with a `foldl` — a line that is correct today and worth remembering: when we build a pretty-printer in [Printing Patterns Back](./pretty-printing.md), this exact fold will come under scrutiny and change direction. Folds have a handedness, and it shows up in the shape of your trees.

### The knot, and why Idris made us tie it

One line above deserves its own section: `group = char '(' *> recur alternation <* char ')'`. What is `recur`? It was added to `Regex/Parse.idr` in this very commit:

```idris
||| Tie the knot for recursive grammars.
|||
||| In a lazy language a grammar can refer to itself and nothing
||| special happens. Idris evaluates eagerly, so a self-referential
||| parser value would try to build itself forever. `recur` accepts
||| the parser *lazily* and only looks inside once input arrives.
public export
recur : Lazy (Parser a) -> Parser a
recur p = MkParser $ \cs => runParser p cs
```

Our grammar is circular: `alternation` needs `atom`, and `atom` (through `group`) needs `alternation`. In Haskell — a lazy language — you write the circular definitions and nothing happens until input arrives; the knot ties itself silently. Idris evaluates eagerly: building `group` requires building `alternation` *right now*, which requires `group`, which requires `alternation`… an infinite regress at construction time, before a single character is parsed. `recur` breaks the loop by accepting its argument as `Lazy (Parser a)` — Idris's explicit "do not evaluate this yet" type — and only touching it inside the lambda, which runs when input shows up. The fix is two lines. The lesson is bigger: laziness is not free magic; it is a semantic choice that Haskell makes globally and silently, and Idris makes locally and *visibly*. Having to write `recur` once, in the one place the grammar bites its own tail, is a fair price for seeing exactly where recursion-in-data actually lives.

Finally, the front door — `Maybe` for now, upgraded in the next chapter:

```idris
||| Compile a pattern string into a regex — or `Nothing` when the
||| pattern is malformed. The parser must consume every character;
||| trailing garbage is a failure, not a warning.
public export
compile : String -> Maybe Regex
compile = parse alternation
```

Those malformed-input specs — `"a)"`, `"[abc"`, `"a{2"` — pass with no rejection code anywhere. `parse` already demands full consumption, so a parser that stops at the stray `)` has failed by definition. We wrote that policy one chapter ago; it just paid out three specs for free.

```sh
make test
```

```
  ...
  ok    the empty pattern is Eps
  ...
  ok    a real-world shape: \w+@\w+\.\w+
  ok    a date pattern, this time written as a pattern
121/121 passed
```

All twenty-three specs, one green commit: [a7eef7c](https://github.com/ubugeeei-prod/lets-start-functional/commit/a7eef7cbef3dcb1c6a53c1dad355a7bcc1341b33). It is worth pausing on that. A hundred and fifty lines of genuinely intricate code — recursive grammar, escapes, classes, counted repetition — landed in a single red-to-green step. That is not bravado; it is the dividend of the [previous chapter](./parser-combinators.md). Every combinator underneath was already specified and tested in isolation, so assembling them was the only step left to get wrong — and the twenty-three specs were standing by to catch even that.

## Summary

- Regex notation is a grammar with precedence; the translation is mechanical — one parser per precedence level, each built from the next-tighter one.
- Specs came in three flavors: structure (the precedence table, executable), malformed input (trailing garbage is failure — enforced by `parse`, no extra code), and behavior (the classics: `colou?r`, `gr[ae]y`, an email shape, the date).
- Postfix operators parse as *functions* `Regex -> Regex`, applied to their atom by a `foldl` — `star`, `plus`, `opt`, `between n m` are the parse results themselves.
- `\D` is one `complement` call; class items each contribute ranges that assemble straight into `MkSet`.
- The grammar's self-reference needs `recur : Lazy (Parser a) -> Parser a` — eager Idris makes visible the knot that lazy Haskell ties silently; and `alternation`'s `foldl alt` is a line with a future ([Printing Patterns Back](./pretty-printing.md)).

`compile` still answers failure with a bare `Nothing` — no position, no message. Turning that into an API worth shipping is [A Public API](./public-api.md).
